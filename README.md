# kotlin-strives-for-dl
Repository to support my talk on [Kotlin](http://kotlinlang.org/) and [Artificial Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) internals if to be more specific [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning).

Usage
===========

To build and run the simplest implementation of Neural Network the only required is JDK 1.8+ installed rest will be done by Gradle.

```bash
    ./gradlew clean build
```
